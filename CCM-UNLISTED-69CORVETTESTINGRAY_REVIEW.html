            <h3 class="pageheadline">1969 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray</h3>

            <div class="mainreviewtxt">
                <p>
                    The 1960s is largely considered the golden era of American muscle cars, when big-block V-8s,
                    Polyglas
                    tires and
                    carburetors ruled the streets. Corvettes were certainly a part of the action, especially in the
                    latter
                    part of the
                    decade. But no Corvette of the time came close to touching the outright abilities of the famed L88.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The L88 designation came with Vettes powered by the mighty 427 cubic-inch big-block that came
                    factory-rated at 430
                    horsepower. However, Chevrolet lied. In reality, the 427 produced well over 500 horsepower. Only 216
                    examples were built
                    between 1967 and 1969, with Chevrolet marketing them towards race teams rather than the general
                    public.

                    That magnificent engine, a de-optioned interior and the high-rise hood were the only visual things
                    separating the L88
                    from the standard C3 Stingray. But the late 1960s were fantastic times for Corvette design. The
                    classic
                    shark body with
                    its side gills, sloping front end, bulging fenders, and wide rear haunches made the Vette one of the
                    curviest, most
                    seductive cars of the era.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Joe Everyman had the option of the standard 350 cubic-inch V-8 or several optional V-8s, including a
                    327, 427 and 454 –
                    all of which came with various tunes throughout the C3’s lifespan. Introduced for the 1968 model
                    year,
                    the
                    third-generation Corvette lasted into the 1980s, when Chevrolet introduced the C4 for 1984. Updates
                    and
                    refreshes came
                    regularly for the C3’s design and interior, making it easy to determine its model year.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Though the C3 enjoyed immense popularity, it’s the rarest version – the L88 – that has gained the
                    most
                    legendary status
                    with collectors. That’s why the particular Stingray pictured here is on the auction block with an
                    estimated selling
                    price between $650,000 and $750,000. Besides its rarity, the car’s value is based on several other
                    factors. Keep reading
                    for them all.

            <h3 class="pageheadline">1998 Toyota Supra</h3>

            <div class="mainreviewtxt">
                <p>
                    Looking like some kind of hybrid between an F-16 and a Ferrari F40, the wide-eyed Supra arrived late
                    in
                    1993 to do battle with everything from the Nissan 300ZX to Lexus SC coupes. The wild exterior cloaks
                    an
                    austere but inviting cabin where the first order of business is driving. Under the hood, you have a
                    choice of two inline six-cylinder engines: a twin-cammer good for 225 horsepower or a twin-turbo
                    version
                    of the same that ups output by 95 horsepower.
                    This year, Toyota applies its Variable Valve Timing with Intelligence technology to the regularly
                    aspirated inline-six engine, giving the base car improved horsepower and torque numbers.

                The automotive press has absolutely gushed about the Supra driving experience. No doubt, this is a
                serious driving machine. However, we've noticed that Toyota has been having trouble lately creating
                attractive sport cars. The Celica is quite a good looking sportster, until the bulging eyes up front
                seemingly follow your every move as you round the hood. The image is one of a shark ready to strike, and
                you find yourself wishing you had a spear to jab into one of the headlights. The Supra is also a
                beautiful work of art, but the hyena-like front styling is disconcerting. The Supra has a wild-eyed
                look, and the huge air intake below the bumper needs only a row of white teeth to guarantee that small
                children would never pass within twenty feet of the front end. The rear, with its rows of
                science-project taillights, massive rear fascia, and obnoxious wing, is just too much. Why Toyota tacked
                this front and rear aberration onto an otherwise restrained and wonderfully styledbody is a mystery.
                <p>
                </p>
                As usual, though, we have a theory. In the United States, the Supra's main market, there really aren't
                any public roads (save for some desolate desert highway) to use the Supra to its full potential. The
                stylists wanted the Supra to be noticed. They wanted it to sell. So they gave it 'Look at me!' styling
                to generate as much of a commotion at a supermarket parking lot as it would at 120 on Interstate 10. It
                works.

                Variable Valve Timing with intelligence appears on the new Supra.
